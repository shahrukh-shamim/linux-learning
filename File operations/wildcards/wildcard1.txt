Wildcard is a character or string used pattern matching.

Globbing expands the wild pattern into a list of files and/or directories. (paths)

Wild can be used with most of the commands like `ls`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`

Two main wild cards
    1. ? (match exactly one character)
        ?.txt
        a?
        a?.txt
    2. * (matches zero or more character)
        *.txt
        a*
        a*.txt
    3. Character class
        ca[nt]* {cat, can, cant, catn, cannnnnnn}
        ca[aeiou]*  start with `c` and `a` and after that only vowels
        ca[!aeiou]* start with `c` and `a` and after that anything but vowel
        [a-g]* All files that may start from a,b, c, d, e, f, g
        myfile[0-2] start with `myfile` and ends on {0,1,2}
    4. Named Character classes
        [[:alpha:]]    
        [[:alnum:]]    
        [[:digit:]]    
        [[:lower:]]    
        [[:space:]]    
        [[:upper:]]
    4. / (to search wild card characters)
