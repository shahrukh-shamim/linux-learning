File Creation Mask:-
    File creation masks determines default permission
    If no masks are used then

    777 for directories
    666 For files

    umask command set file creation mode but it works opposite to that of chmod
    For example 7 for CHOWN means all permissions but for umask no permissions

Change group command:-
	chgrp groupname filename.txt

When a new file is created, it automatically get assign to your primary group

umask:-
To assign default permission to new file/directory

For example consider a directory `documents`, lets cd into it first, for umask to work

Type      | Base Permission
directory | 777
file      | 666

So if we `umask 002`

And create a directory `my-dir` and a file `my-file.txt`
Then their permission would be

mydir -> 777 - 002 = 775
mydir -> 666 - 002 = 664
